# Poly112
## Game Description
In this game (Poly112) you will be designing your own bridge!
To win the game you must design your bridge in such a way that the ball goes across the bridge without falling.
Explore your options! Use different support pieces, try making jumps, anything that you believe would make a cool looking bridg.
After you have passed making one bridge, terrain at new heights will be made and you can make another bridge.
If you fall off the bridge at any point, you would have to redo the level and not get new terrain
Be warned, if you go overbudget you will have to redo the level as well, so be sure to make ur build less expensive
Have fun Playing Poly112!
